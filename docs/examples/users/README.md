# User examples

This section contains 3 examples for creating RabbitMQ users.
Messaging Topology Operator creates users with generated credentials by default. To create RabbitMQ users with provided credentials, you can reference a kubernetes secret object contains keys `username` and `password` in its Data field.
See [userPreDefinedCreds.yaml](./userPreDefinedCreds.yaml) and [publish-consume-user.yaml](./publish-consume-user.yaml) as examples.
Note that Messaging Topology Operator does not watch the provided secret and updating the secret object won't update actual user credentials.
The User controller will generate a new secret from the provided secret named by appending the suffix `-user-credentials` to the username. For example, if your User is named `user-test` the controller will generate a secret `user-test-user-credentials`.
If you wish to update User credentials, you can update the secret generated by the controller and then add a label or annotation to the User object to trigger a reconcile loop.
