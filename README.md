# RabbitMQ Messaging Topology Kubernetes Operator

Kubernetes operator to manage [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) messaging topologies within a RabbitMQ cluster deployed via the [RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/). This repository contains [custom controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-controllers) and [custom resource definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions) enabling a declarative API for RabbitMQ messaging topologies.

**Note:** This project is under active development and is provided as **beta** software. There is no guarantee of API backwards compatibility, release schedule, or providing support.

## Quickstart

Before deploying Messaging Topology Operator, you need to have:

1. A Running k8s cluster
2. RabbitMQ [Cluster Operator](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator) installed in the k8s cluster
3. A [RabbitMQ cluster](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/tree/main/docs/examples) deployed using the Cluster Operator

If you have [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/) `1.2.0` or above installed in your k8s cluster, and `kubectl` configured to access your running k8s cluster, you can then run the following command to install the Messaging Topology Operator:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/rabbitmq/messaging-topology-operator/releases/latest/download/messaging-topology-operator-with-certmanager.yaml
```

If you do not have cert-manager installed in your k8s cluster, you will need to generate certificates used by admission webhooks yourself and include them in the operator and webhooks manifests.
You can follow [this doc](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/install-topology-operator.html).

You can create RabbitMQ resources:

1. [Queue](./docs/examples/queues)
2. [Exchange](./docs/examples/exchanges)
3. [Binding](./docs/examples/bindings)
4. [User](./docs/examples/users)
5. [Vhost](./docs/examples/vhosts)
6. [Policy](./docs/examples/policies)
7. [Permissions](./docs/examples/permissions)

## Documentation

Messaging Topology Operator is covered in several guides:

 - [Operator overview](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/operator-overview.html#topology-operator)
 - [Installation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/install-topology-operator.html)
 - [Using Messaging Topology Operator](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/using-topology-operator.html)
 - [TLS](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/tls-topology-operator.html)
 - [Troubleshooting Messaging Topology Operator](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/troubleshooting-topology-operator.html)

In addition, a number of [examples](./docs/examples) can be found in this repository.

The doc guides are open source. The source can be found in the [RabbitMQ website repository](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-website/)
under `site/kubernetes`.

## RabbitMQCluster requirements

Messaging Topology Operator is tested with the latest release of RabbitMQ [Cluster Operator](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator).
It uses the generated default user secret from RabbitmqCluster (set in `rabbitmqcluster.status.binding`) to authenticate with RabbitMQ server.
If your RabbitmqCluster is deployed with import definitions or provided default user credentials,
the default user secret from `rabbitmqcluster.status.binding` may not be correct and Messaging Topology Operator will fail with authentication error.
If your RabbitmqCluster is configured to serve management traffic over TLS, you may need to configure the Messaging Topology Operator to trust the CA that signed the server's certificates. For more information, see [this doc](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/tls-topology-operator.html).
