# RabbitMQ Messaging Topology Kubernetes Operator

Kubernetes operator to manage [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) messaging topologies within a RabbitMQ cluster deployed via the [RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/). This repository contains [custom controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-controllers) and [custom resource definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions) enabling a declarative API for RabbitMQ messaging topologies.

**Note:** This project is under active development and is provided as **alpha** software. There is no guarantee of API backwards compatibility, release schedule, or providing support.

## Quickstart

Before deploying Messaging Topology Operator, you need to have:

1. A Running k8s cluster
2. RabbitMQ [Cluster Operator](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator) installed in the k8s cluster
3. A [RabbitMQ cluster](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/tree/main/docs/examples) deployed using the Cluster Operator

If you have `kubectl` configured to access your running k8s cluster, you can then run the following command to install the Messaging Topology Operator:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/rabbitmq/messaging-topology-operator/releases/download/latest/messaging-topology-operator.yml
```

You can create RabbitMQ resources:

1. [Queue](./docs/examples/queues)
2. [Exchange](./docs/examples/exchanges)
3. [Binding](./docs/examples/bindings)
4. [User](./docs/examples/users)
5. [Vhost](./docs/examples/vhosts)
6. [Policy](./docs/examples/policies)
